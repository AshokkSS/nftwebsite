      <h3>A 10 minute read covering everything you need to know!</h3>
      <br />
      <p class="textinfo">
        Before you can dive into the world of NFT's you need to have a rough
        understanding of what Cryptocurrency is, after all it's the currency
        that you will be using. If this is your first time learning about
        crypto don't worry this guide will break it down as simple as
        possible, but if you already understand how crypto works click <a href="#nft">here</a> to
        skip this section and get right into NFT's.

      <h2 style="font-size:30px">Understanding Crypto</h2>
      <br />
      <p class="textinfo">
        At its core, cryptocurrency is typically decentralized digital money
        designed to be used over the internet. Bitcoin, which launched in
        2008, was the first cryptocurrency, and it remains by far the biggest,
        most influential, and best-known. In the decade since, Bitcoin and
        other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have grown as digital
        alternatives to money issued by governments. Crypto makes it possible
        to transfer value online without the need for a middleman like a bank
        or payment processor, allowing value to transfer globally,
        near-instantly, 24/7, for low fees. Cryptocurrencies are usually not
        issued or controlled by any government or other central authority.
        They’re managed by peer-to-peer networks of computers running free,
        open-source software. Generally, anyone who wants to participate is
        able to. If a bank or government isn’t involved, how is crypto secure?
        It’s secure because all transactions are vetted by a technology called
        a blockchain. A cryptocurrency blockchain is similar to a bank’s
        balance sheet or ledger. Each currency has its own blockchain, which
        is an ongoing, constantly re-verified record of every single
        transaction ever made using that currency. Unlike a bank’s ledger, a
        crypto blockchain is distributed across participants of the digital
        currency’s entire network No company, country, or third party is in
        control of it; and anyone can participate. A blockchain is a
        breakthrough technology only recently made possible through decades of
        computer science and mathematical innovations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <a id="nft"></a>
      <h2 style="font-size:30px">How does Crypto work with NFT's?</h2>
      <p class="textinfo">
        As many NFT's can be considered as art, I will use it as an example to
        explain. When expensive art works are purchased in real life they will
        be paid for in cash, this may be in Pounds, Dollars, Euros any
        currency. In the world of NFT's it is the same concept you are
        purchasing an NFT but instead of paying with regular money you are
        paying using Crypto (ETH or SOL). Also because any transaction made
        using crypto will be on the blockchain for that crypto currency all
        the transactions are visible and can be tracked. So if you own an NFT
        the blockchain proves you are the owner, this adds more security to
        your NFT's as no one will be able to steal your NFT (even if they
        screenshot it they won't own it!)
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>What do you need to get started?</h2>
      <ul class="a">
        <li>
          <h2>First you need to own crypto, in this case Solana.</h2>
        </li>
        <p class="textinfo">
          When deciding how much crypto you want to purchase, you should know a few things about crypto, the markets
          most times are very volatile so you should only buy an amount you are comfortable with, as the value of your
          Solana can fluctuate very easily. <a href="https://www.binance.com/en-GB/how-to-buy/solana"
            target="_blank">Here</a> is Binance's guide to buying Solana, if you want to use any other major crypto
          exchange it will be a similar process.
        </p>
        <li>
          <h2>Now you have Crypto how can you use it to buy NFT's?</h2>
          <p class="textinfo">
            So to use the crypto you have purchased you need to have a Solana specific wallet (this wallet will be used
            to store your Solana and any NFT's you accquire). This wallet acts the same as your normal everyday wallet
            but instead of having cash you have Solana! There are many different Solana wallets available but the most
            popular and secure one is Phantom Wallet, and <a
              href="https://help.phantom.app/hc/en-us/articles/4406388623251-How-to-create-a-new-wallet"
              target="_blank">here</a> is the official guide on how to create a wallet from the Phantom website.
            <br />

              class="smallimage"></img>
            <figcaption style="color:red;">YOU SHOULD NEVER SHARE YOUR SECRET RECOVERY PHRASE WITH ANYONE!</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <br />
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>So you have your wallet, how can you move your crypto to it?</h2>
          <p class="textinfo">
            Great now your wallet is setup a few more steps and your wallet will be ready to buy and sell NFT's. Head
            over to Binance (or the exchange you used to purchase your Solana) and find your Solana you should see
            options to Buy Sell Deposit Withdraw Trade Earn Convert.
            <br />
            <img src="images/binance-solana.png" class="smallimage"></img>
            <br />
            Then select Withdraw what this does is it withdraws the Solana from your Binance account and you can send it
            to your Phantom wallet, where it can be used to buy your NFTs.
            <br />
          <figure>
            <img src="images/binance-solana-withdraw.png" class="smallimage"></img>
            <figcaption style="color:red;"> MAKE SURE THE NETWORK IS SOL Solana AS IF IT IS NOT YOUR CRYPTO WILL BE
              LOST!</figcaption>
          </figure>
          Now just copy your address from your Phantom wallet and paste it in Binance and withdraw, and shortly after it
          will appear in your Phantom wallet! Once the Solana you withdrew appears in your Phantom wallet you are now
          ready to buy and sell NFT's which is up next in this guide!
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h2>Checklist when buying NFT's:</h2>
      <br />
      <p class="textinfo">
        So now you are ready to buy and sell NFT's but how can you find out what NFT's are worth buying? Before you go
        searching through marketplaces for some NFT's to purchase you should think about a few things:
      <ul class="a">
        <li>
          <h2>Is it beginner friendly?</h2>
          <p class="textinfo">Most NFT projects will be anticipating for people who are new to the NFT space to be
            joining, so they should have very simple and clear guides to explain how to buy one of their NFT's along
            with any red flags to look out for.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Does it look nice?</h2>
          <p class="textinfo">After all most NFT's are considered to be art so you want to make sure it looks good
            before you purchase it!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Is the project reliable?</h2>
          <p class="textinfo">So you should look through the project's social media like their Twitter, Discord,
            Instagram, any social media showing what the project plans to do. If a page has 100,000 followers but only
            get 100-200 likes on their posts that is a RED FLAG as these followers were most likely purchased or botted.
          </p>

              class="smallimage"></img>
            <figcaption>This is a checklist from Magiceden for NFT Marketing, but it can be used for you to check if a
              project is legit or not.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Are the creators reliable?</h2>
          <p class="textinfo">Look into the developers/owners most will post their twitter or their linkedin so just go
            through
            their tweets see what they’re saying and see if they own any big nfts and if they’re interested in crypto
            etc.
            Also see if they’ve been involved in any previous projects and how did they do.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Is the community interested?</h2>
          <p class="textinfo">This is similar to going through their social media, all NFT projects will have a discord
            or some sort of chat place where everyone who is interested in the project can join and discuss the project.
            You should be looking for how the members of the community talk about the project:</p>
          <ul class="a">
            <li>
              <p class="textinfo">Are they interested in the project?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="textinfo">Are the creators of the project interacting with the community?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="textinfo">What is the general vibe of the community?</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="textinfo">As you go through more and more projects you will develop a better understanding of what
            you should look out for.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      </p>

      <h2>NFT Key Terms:</h2>
      <br />
      <p class="textinfo"> Here are all the key terms you will need to know:</p>

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="textinfo">Floor - The floor is set by the lowest priced NFT on the market. (example: If the
            cheapest

        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="textinfo">Secondary Market - Sometimes referred to as Secondary for short, a Secondary Market is a

        <li>
          <p class="textinfo">Roadmap - The written out direction a project will continue to build in. Their
            blueprint.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="textinfo">DYOR - Do your own research</p>

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="textinfo">Pump/Dump - Pumping is when the floor is being swept by people (pushing the price up),
            and
            Dumping is when a bunch are
            being sold at once.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="textinfo">DAO - *Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Most DAO's are closed community of people
            that provide intel, make group
            decisions on votes, etc.

        </li>
        <li>

          </p>
        </li>

          <p class="textinfo">FOMO - Fear of Missing Out. Some people will buy into a project that is already pumping
            due to FOMO, or they'll sell
            another project to buy something else "before its too late".
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="textinfo">* DAO's are a great first investment as they are great with providing information on which
        NFT projects have potential to do well, which ones could potentially be a scam, and in general assist you on
        your NFT journey.</p>
