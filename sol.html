      <br />
      <p class="textinfo">
        Before you can dive into the world of NFT's you need to have a rough
        understanding of what Cryptocurrency is, after all it's the currency
        that you will be using. If this is your first time learning about
        crypto don't worry this guide will break it down as simple as
        possible, but if you already understand how crypto works click <a href="#nft">here</a> to
        skip this section and get right into NFT's.

      <h2 style="font-size:30px">Understanding Crypto</h2>
      <br />
      <p class="textinfo">
        At its core, cryptocurrency is typically decentralized digital money
        designed to be used over the internet. Bitcoin, which launched in
        2008, was the first cryptocurrency, and it remains by far the biggest,
        most influential, and best-known. In the decade since, Bitcoin and
        other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have grown as digital
        alternatives to money issued by governments. Crypto makes it possible
        to transfer value online without the need for a middleman like a bank
        or payment processor, allowing value to transfer globally,
        near-instantly, 24/7, for low fees. Cryptocurrencies are usually not
        issued or controlled by any government or other central authority.
        They’re managed by peer-to-peer networks of computers running free,
        open-source software. Generally, anyone who wants to participate is
        able to. If a bank or government isn’t involved, how is crypto secure?
        It’s secure because all transactions are vetted by a technology called
        a blockchain. A cryptocurrency blockchain is similar to a bank’s
        balance sheet or ledger. Each currency has its own blockchain, which
        is an ongoing, constantly re-verified record of every single
        transaction ever made using that currency. Unlike a bank’s ledger, a
        crypto blockchain is distributed across participants of the digital
        currency’s entire network No company, country, or third party is in
        control of it; and anyone can participate. A blockchain is a
        breakthrough technology only recently made possible through decades of
        computer science and mathematical innovations.

      <h2 style="font-size:30px">How does Crypto work with NFT's?</h2>
      <p class="textinfo">
        As many NFT's can be considered as art, I will use it as an example to
        explain. When expensive art works are purchased in real life they will
        be paid for in cash, this may be in Pounds, Dollars, Euros any
        currency. In the world of NFT's it is the same concept you are
        purchasing an NFT but instead of paying with regular money you are
        paying using Crypto (ETH or SOL). Also because any transaction made
        using crypto will be on the blockchain for that crypto currency all
        the transactions are visible and can be tracked. So if you own an NFT
        the blockchain proves you are the owner, this adds more security to
        your NFT's as no one will be able to steal your NFT (even if they
        screenshot it they won't own it!)
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>What do you need to get started?</h2>
      <ul class="a" >
        <li>
          <h2>First you need to own crypto, in this case Solana.</h2>
        </li>
        <p class="textinfo">
          When deciding how much crypto you want to purchase, you should know a few things about crypto, the markets most times are very volatile so you should only buy an amount you are comfortable with, as the value of your Solana can fluctuate very easily. <a href="https://www.binance.com/en-GB/how-to-buy/solana" target="_blank">Here</a> is Binance's guide to buying Solana, if you want to use any other major crypto exchange it will be a similar process.
        </p>
        <li>
          <h2>Now you have Crypto how can you use it to buy NFT's?</h2>
          <p class="textinfo">
            So to use the crypto you have purchased you need to have a Solana specific wallet (this wallet will be used to store your Solana and any NFT's you accquire). This wallet acts the same as your normal everyday wallet but instead of having cash you have Solana! There are many different Solana wallets available but the most popular and secure one is Phantom Wallet, and <a href="https://help.phantom.app/hc/en-us/articles/4406388623251-How-to-create-a-new-wallet" target="_blank">here</a> is the official guide on how to create a wallet from the Phantom website.

              <figcaption style="color:red;">YOU SHOULD NEVER SHARE YOUR SECRET RECOVERY PHRASE WITH ANYONE!</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>So you have your wallet, how can you move your crypto to it?</h2>
          <p class="textinfo">
            Great now your wallet is setup a few more steps and your wallet will be ready to buy and sell NFT's. Head over to Binance (or the exchange you used to purchase your Solana) and find your Solana you should see options to Buy Sell Deposit Withdraw Trade Earn Convert.
            <br>
            <img src = "images/binance-solana.png" class="smallimage"></img>
            Then select Withdraw what this does is it withdraws the Solana from your Binance account and you can send it to your Phantom wallet, where it can be used to buy your NFTs.
            <figure>
              <img src = "images/binance-solana-withdraw.png" class="smallimage"></img>
              <figcaption style="color:red;"> MAKE SURE THE NETWORK IS SOL Solana AS IF IT IS NOT YOUR CRYPTO WILL BE LOST!</figcaption>
            </figure>
            Now just copy your address from your Phantom wallet and paste it in Binance and withdraw, and shortly after it will appear in your Phantom wallet! Once the Solana you withdrew appears in your Phantom wallet you are now ready to buy and sell NFT's which is up next in this guide!
