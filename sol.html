          Before you can dive into the world of NFT's you need to have a rough
          understanding of what Cryptocurrency is, after all it's the currency
          that you will be using. If this is your first time learning about
          crypto don't worry this guide will break it down as simple as
          possible, but if you already understand how crypto works click here to

        <h2>Understanding Crypto</h2>
        <br />
        <p class="textinfo">
          At its core, cryptocurrency is typically decentralized digital money
          designed to be used over the internet. Bitcoin, which launched in
          2008, was the first cryptocurrency, and it remains by far the biggest,
          most influential, and best-known. In the decade since, Bitcoin and
          other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have grown as digital
          alternatives to money issued by governments. Crypto makes it possible
          to transfer value online without the need for a middleman like a bank
          or payment processor, allowing value to transfer globally,
          near-instantly, 24/7, for low fees. Cryptocurrencies are usually not
          issued or controlled by any government or other central authority.
          They’re managed by peer-to-peer networks of computers running free,
          open-source software. Generally, anyone who wants to participate is
          able to. If a bank or government isn’t involved, how is crypto secure?
          It’s secure because all transactions are vetted by a technology called
          a blockchain. A cryptocurrency blockchain is similar to a bank’s
          balance sheet or ledger. Each currency has its own blockchain, which
          is an ongoing, constantly re-verified record of every single
          transaction ever made using that currency. Unlike a bank’s ledger, a
          crypto blockchain is distributed across participants of the digital
          currency’s entire network No company, country, or third party is in
          control of it; and anyone can participate. A blockchain is a
          breakthrough technology only recently made possible through decades of
          computer science and mathematical innovations.

        <h2>How does Crypto work with NFT's?</h2>
        <p class="textinfo">
          As many NFT's can be considered as art, I will use it as an example to
          explain. When expensive art works are purchased in real life they will
          be paid for in cash, this may be in Pounds, Dollars, Euros any
          currency. In the world of NFT's it is the same concept you are
          purchasing an NFT but instead of paying with regular money you are
          paying using Crypto (ETH or SOL). Also because any transaction made
          using crypto will be on the blockchain for that crypto currency all
          the transactions are visible and can be tracked. So if you own an NFT
          the blockchain proves you are the owner, this adds more security to
          your NFT's as no one will be able to steal your NFT (even if they
          screenshot it they won't own it!)
